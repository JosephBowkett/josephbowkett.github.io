2019-01-01	Tactile Sensing and Control of Robotic Manipulator Integrating Fiber Bragg Grating Strain-Sensor.	Frontiers In Neurorobotics	Tactile sensing is an instrumental modality of robotic manipulation, as it provides information that is not accessible via remote sensors such as cameras or lidars. Touch is particularly crucial in unstructured environments, where the robot's internal representation of manipulated objects is uncertain. In this study we present the sensorization of an existing artificial hand, with the aim to achieve fine control of robotic limbs and perception of object's physical properties. Tactile feedback is conveyed by means of a soft sensor integrated at the fingertip of a robotic hand. The sensor consists of an optical fiber, housing Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) transducers, embedded into a soft polymeric material integrated on a rigid hand. Through several tasks involving grasps of different objects in various conditions, the ability of the system to acquire information is assessed. Results show that a classifier based on the sensor outputs of the robotic hand is capable of accurately detecting both size and rigidity of the operated objects (99.36 and 100% accuracy, respectively). Furthermore, the outputs provide evidence of the ability to grab fragile objects without breakage or slippage e and to perform dynamic manipulative tasks, that involve the adaptation of fingers position based on the grasped objects' condition.

2018-05-21	Semantic Understanding of Task Outcomes: Visually Identifying Failure Modes Autonomously Discovered in Simulation	ICRA Representing a Complex World	We present a model for identifying and recognizing task success and distinct modes of task failure in robot manipulation applications. Our model leverages physics simulation and clustering to learn symbolic failure modes, and a deep network to extract visual signatures for each mode and to guide failure recovery. We present an early experiment where we apply our model to the archetypal manipulation task of placing objects into a container. A CNN is trained on synthetic depth images generated and labeled in simulation, and we demonstrate the ability of the network to compute task outcomes in both synthetic and real depth images.

2017-08-06	Comparison of control methods for two-link planar flexible manipulator	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences	While the majority of terrestrial multi-link manipulators can be considered in a purely kinematic sense due to their high stiffness, the launch mass restrictions of aerospace applications such as in-orbit assembly of large space structures result in low stiffness links being employed, meaning dynamics can no longer be ignored. This paper seeks to investigate the suitability of several different  open  and  closed  loop  control  techniques  for  application to the problem of end effector position control with minimal vibration for a low stiffness space based manipulator.  Simulations of a representative planar problem with two flexible links are used to measure performance and sensitivity to parameter variation of:  model predictive control,  command shaping,  and command shaping with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback. An experimental testbed is then used to validate simulation results for the recommended command shaped controller.	"Bowkett J., and Mukherjee R.

2016-10-03	Combined Energy Harvesting and Control of Moball: A Barycentric Spherical Robot	International Symposium on Experimental Robotics	The mobile sensor platform Moball uses an array of sliding magnets and solenoids inside a spherical shell to both harvest energy and displace its center of mass or barycenter from its center of rotation in order to control the path along which it rolls. Previous simulations of the harvesting potential for the complete system are validated experimentally, and certain phenomena that restrict effective operating conditions for energy harvesting are investigated. Tracking of characteristic trajectories for a single mass control element is used to assess the performance of the solenoids as actuators, and the ability of the system to generate a control torque during motion is demonstrated.
