excerpt: 'Exploring the water-rich surface of Europa is a desirable planetary ex-ploration objective for the coming decades. Knowledge of the Europan terrain isrelatively uncertain and therefore to perform mobile surface operations a versatilemobility  system  capable  of  adapting  its  locomotion  is  desirable.  Our  work  sum-marizes preliminary efforts to evaluate a variety of wheel-on-limb mobility modeson Europan analogue terrain populated with unstructured salt-evaporite formations.A redundant wheel-on-limb quadruped,RoboSimian, has been adapted to performtraverses  over  unstructured  terrain  with  obstacles  up  to  50  cm  tall  (1.6  times  itswheel diameter). Multiple mobility modes that are combinations of wheeled andlimbed motion primitives are proposed and evaluated over varying roughness ter-rain as a function of energy usage. In combination with these mobility modes, amode-agnostic actively articulated suspension control scheme that maintains groundtraction,  regulates  chassis  orientation  and  prevents  suspension  saturation  is  pre-sented. The controller uses an inverse kinematics solver that leverages pre-computedlookup-tables for each limb.

Exploring the water-rich surface of Europa is a desirable planetary ex-ploration objective for the coming decades. Knowledge of the Europan terrain isrelatively uncertain and therefore to perform mobile surface operations a versatilemobility  system  capable  of  adapting  its  locomotion  is  desirable.  Our  work  sum-marizes preliminary efforts to evaluate a variety of wheel-on-limb mobility modeson Europan analogue terrain populated with unstructured salt-evaporite formations.A redundant wheel-on-limb quadruped,RoboSimian, has been adapted to performtraverses  over  unstructured  terrain  with  obstacles  up  to  50  cm  tall  (1.6  times  itswheel diameter). Multiple mobility modes that are combinations of wheeled andlimbed motion primitives are proposed and evaluated over varying roughness ter-rain as a function of energy usage. In combination with these mobility modes, amode-agnostic actively articulated suspension control scheme that maintains groundtraction,  regulates  chassis  orientation  and  prevents  suspension  saturation  is  pre-sented. The controller uses an inverse kinematics solver that leverages pre-computedlookup-tables for each limb. This is shown to be simple yet effective in the field andis able to scale to a robot with 32 degrees-of-freedom.
