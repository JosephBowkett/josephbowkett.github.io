excerpt: 'The mobile sensor platform Moball uses an array of sliding magnets and solenoids inside a spherical shell to both harvest energy and displace its center of mass or barycenter from its center of rotation in order to control the path along which it rolls. Previous simulations of the harvesting potential for the complete system are validated experimentally, and certain phenomena that restrict effective operating conditions for energy harvesting are investigated. Tracking of characteristic trajectories for a single mass control element is used to assess the performance of the solenoids as actuators, and the ability of the system to generate a control torque during motion is demonstrated.'

The mobile sensor platform Moball uses an array of sliding magnets and solenoids inside a spherical shell to both harvest energy and displace its center of mass or barycenter from its center of rotation in order to control the path along which it rolls. Previous simulations of the harvesting potential for the complete system are validated experimentally, and certain phenomena that restrict effective operating conditions for energy harvesting are investigated. Tracking of characteristic trajectories for a single mass control element is used to assess the performance of the solenoids as actuators, and the ability of the system to generate a control torque during motion is demonstrated.
